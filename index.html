					<h2 class="afterpic">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</h2>

					<p>I currently reside in Spokane Washington, living in the beautiful Perry district with my girlfriend Brooke and son Ellis. I am finishing my last year at EWU. I fullfill my need to create and love of food by cooking on the weekends at the Lantern Tap House. My major in visual communication design and minor in studio art, presented itself as the perfect commingling of the logical and intuitive, artistic nature, giving me the opportunity to create objects with a lasting impact on culture, society, and commercial industries. My self-motivated style of learning has allowed me to jump into my educational endeavors full force and has earned me a wide liberal arts education. I describe my design skills as concise and informed. I find the most important, and influential leaders of the past are those who are service leaders and lead by example. This is because I am more like a curious observer who carefully soaks in the world around him. I consider my nature more like that of water, which gives and bends around anything that is thrown it’s way, but does not break and maintains it’s integrity. Unlike a hard surface that asserts itself into this world, I choose to integrate the world around into my creative endevours. Leading by this example, I  am careful to consider my audience when sharing my points of view in a creative setting and do enjoy sharing them.  </p>

					<h2>PROFESSIONAL OBJECTIVES</h2>

					<p class="last">I am a communication artist seeking an entry-level position. I am eager to learn and excited to get to work. I prefer to be involved in the whole design process from strategizing and conceptualization to presenting to clients, in order to produce a cohesive functional design. My fine arts background, expertise of technical design tools, and knowledge of advertising concepts help me to produce creative and effective solutions.</p>
